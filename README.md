# Winter Break Project
You goal will be to choose an old project that you haven't had a chance to finish (it can either be a project you started in class, or a side project you started on your own) and keep working on your project, individually, to try to complete it. Everyone will be presenting their project to the class after break (there will be prizes!).

After break we will be learning more about project management and will be doing group projects pretty much until the end of the course. Think of this as a test run to practice project management, scoping out projects, trying to set realistic goals, and then executing on them. This will also be a good chance to start practicing creating a polished product demo, before we get to Capstone demos.

## Instructions
1. Start off by looking through old projects and choosing the one that you would like to focus on
1. Once you have chosen your project, create goals for what you would like to complete over break. Be specific. For example, what features would you like to add? What would you like to refactor? What bugs would you like to fix? Come up with a plan of action and write it down.
1. Setup a project management board for your project using [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) and start prioritizing your goals. Also add a time estimate for how long you think each one will take to complete.
1. After you have completed those three steps, fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSh9DlmwXQSftpliSh8U9HbmfQAqMODnfqRm2uh6Yl22bZ7A/viewform) with your plans.

## Technical Requirements
- you must use git and github
- your project must have a backend (using Sequelize and Express). this is a good opportunity to go back to an old project that only has a frontend, and add a backend to it
- you should use React. it is up to you whether you'd like to use Redux or not

## Project Demos
- every one will demo their project on the first day of class after break. think of this as a test run for future projects demos (like your Capstone), and general public speaking practice
- you'll have five minutes to demo your project
- your demos should be PRACTICED and POLISHED. In other words, you should take time to plan out your demonstration, and practice it at least a few times
